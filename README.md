# Pulse-Width-Modulation
A Verilog HDL project to create a pwm with the use of counters.
Flipflop based asynchronous counters can divide frequencies easily. If we set the counter to a certain value we can easily manipulate the output wave . This project uses the same principle to generate a pwm wave as an output.
All the files necessary to carry out the project are present in this repository.
